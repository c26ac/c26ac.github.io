<p> Journal Entry 1 — September 23rd, 2022
	<br> <br> In computer science 1 this week, I learned about what it meant for something to be 'meta'. It was pretty cool because it turned out to apply to Computer Science, as well as our History class that day! It's good to know it means more than just the Instagram/Facebook company...Also, its not the easiest, but its nice to know that coding a website is not as scary as it seems!

	<br> <br> I just coded my person card. I made a transition with two different paintings of cakes. Even though there are directions, I still kept on making small mistakes. However, it was very satisfying to see it come together in the end. Coding with html is very different from python; it's been a switch from last year's currriculum. However, I'm excited to learn more about it! 

<p> Journal Entry 3 — September 31st, 2022
	<br> <br> I am beginning to code my website! It's definitely confusing, but I think I'm getting somewhere. I am just starting to get a grasp on how the user interface works and how to categorize different pieces of code throughout the head, body, etc. The cheet sheets and videos have been lifesavers!! 

<p> Journal Entry 4 — October 17th, 2022
	<br> <br> I just made my first ever project and animation in CSS! I made an animation that would flip through all of the desserts in my "bakery." I think my code works the way it does because in my first div in the style section, I specify how big I want my animation to appear, and I said that I want it to fill up the whole screen which would explain its size. In that div I also specified that I want it to last for 30 seconds, which explains its duration. Then, most importantly, I wanted it to include 10 different frames so I divided 100% by 10 to get 10% intervals. So, I typed in each of these intervals along with the ten photos I wanted, which told the system that I wanted those photos to appear at those times, allowing my animation to function!
