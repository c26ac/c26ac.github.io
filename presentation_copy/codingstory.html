				<section data-background-color="beige"><p>Hi! I'm Angie. As you may know from my previous projects, I LOVE to bake. <br><br> However, I often have found that I really only present the final products of baking...</p></section>

				<section data-background-color="beige" p>Although fun nevertheless, the process of baking can be quite unorganized and chaotic sometimes. I wanted to make a website about my baking process not only as a functional tool to keep myself more organized while baking, but also as a way to share how I like to baje.</p></section>

					<p>As I bake with an emphasis on not only a cake's flavor but also its decoration, I decided on four categories to focus on in my cake making process.</p></section>

				<section data-background-color="beige" ><p><b>3. Tools</b> <br>Just like piping tips (one of the tools used), I have developed a roster of favorite tools I use to make each and every cake. I started out with barely using any of these, but they have become essentials in baking for me and I can't imagine baking without them!

				<section data-background-color="beige" ><p>Additionally, I added an about me section for people to get a better understanding of where my love of baking comes from and my experience with it. I made this using a simple textbox, but I thought it would important to include.</p></section>
