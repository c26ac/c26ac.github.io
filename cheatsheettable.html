				What is a <b>variable</b>? What do we use them for? How do we create them?
				
			</td>
			A variable is a term that can store information. Variables can be reffered to in different instances in order to make them function in different ways or use multiple pieces of info in conjunction with one another. They can be created by using "var" and then whatever you would like the name the variable afterwards. Variables go in the body of an html file. Example: "var x"

			<td>
				A function is like a recipe in javascript. It is a set of things that will be done under one singular term. They may already be defined or you can create them yourself. You can call a function by typing the function and then (). Example: If the name of the function was function, then type "function()"
