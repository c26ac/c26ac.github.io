					<p class="fragment" >this is a cake that i just made with cake mix from the store in 2nd grade. i was immersed in the internet-wide trend of oversaturated rainbows and i decided to include this in a cake. obviously it's pretty messy.</p>

				<section data-background-color="beige" data-background-size="contain" data-background-image="firstvintagecake.jpg">

					<p class="fragment" > so a few years ago i tried vintage piping for the first time - it was a nice first attempt but the cake was too short and the piping was smushed together. i was still using cake mix and store bought frosting.</p>

					</section>




				<section data-background-color="beige" data-background-size="contain" data-background-image="meltedcake.jpg">

					<p>i tried again with a different design and i made my own frosting but it was too watery - this definitely looks better, but still looks melted</p></section>



				<section data-background-color="beige" data-background-size="contain" data-background-image="bettercake.jpg"> <p> overtime i finally found my favorite cake recipes and frosting recipe, and this cake really showed improvement. i also practiced my piping more and was able to make more designs.</p></section>

				
				<section data-background-color="beige" data-background-size="contain" data-background-image="bowcake.png"><p>this cake and the next are more recent cakes of mine</p></section>
				<section data-background-color="beige" data-background-size="contain" data-background-image="heartcake.png"><p>i'm really happy with how they came out and can't wait to make more cakes in the future.</p></section>
